    <dt>About us</dt>
    <dd>
      We are IceFlag, a company who is currently setting up a business in exhaust systems. The website will be in Dutch for the Dutch market. At the moment the logistical network has been set up. In order to complete the final stage of being operational, the product line needs to be added to the website. The website runs on Magento.<br/>
      All details will be entered in Dutch and will be translated from German. In order to make this a smooth process, this site has been created. <br/>
      On this site, you can communicate with me (Dirk), I am here to assist you. If you need any help, just send a message via the communication tab. <br/>
      In total, around 15,000 products will need to be entered into the system, however to start, jobs of 500 or 1,000 products entering will be available.

    <dt>Purpose</dt>

    <dt>Responsibilities</dt>
    <dd>
      Quality is the most important aspect. Since this project is working with two foreign languages for you, quality is even more important. Therefore, if you run into any problems, you need to communicate it with me. <br/>
      During the process, I will check your quality reguraly and provide you with feedback.
    </dd>
    <dt>Scope</dt>
    <dd>
      The project will take around 111 hours for adding 1,000 products. 0,02 USD will be paid per product entered. Furhtermore you need to enter at least 35 products per day, or 245 per week. This is around two hours per day, which we think is very reasonable. <br/>
      You are allowed to work many more hours on it, and have it finished as fast as you can. If you manage to finish it fast then more work is available.
    </dd>
    <dt>Key Duties</dt>
    <dd>
      Your duty is to follow the instructions and enter the product according the standards we set. Furthermore your duty is to contact me if you run into any problems or need help.
    </dd>
    <dt>Payment</dt>
    <dd>
      You will be paid 0,02 USD per product. Only 500 or 1,000 product jobs are available. So you will either earn 100 USD or 200 USD. <br/>
      In case you decided to quit, let's say, after 300 products, please communicate this with me, it is still possible for you to receive payment for the work you have done!
